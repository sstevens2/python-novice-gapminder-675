## Installing Python Using Anaconda

[Python][python] is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for
general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its scientific packages
individually can be a bit difficult, however, so we recommend the all-in-one
installer [Anaconda][anaconda].

Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you install Python
version 3.x (e.g., 3.4 is fine). Also, please set up your python environment at 
least a day in advance of the workshop.  If you encounter problems with the 
installation procedure, ask your workshop organizers via e-mail for assistance so
you are ready to go as soon as the workshop begins.

### Ubuntu for Windows

1. Open Ubnutu for Windows 10

2. Download the Python 3 installer for Windows. Change the url below to say 32 instead of 64 if you have a 32-bit operating system.

    ~~~
    $ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ~~~
    {: .bash}


3. Run the installer by typing the following command. Read the license agreement and accept the terms when prompted.  At the end of the installer it will ask if it should add it to the path, type "yes" and press enter.
   
    ~~~
    $ bash Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ~~~
    {: .bash}
  
4. Close and reopen your terminal (Ubuntu for Windows). 

5. Check your install by typing `which python`.  It should read `/home/USERNAME/anaconda3/bin/python`.  If not, add anaconda to your path by adding `export PATH=/home/USERNAME/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"` to the bottom of your `~/.bashrc` file.

### Mac OS X - [Video tutorial][video-mac]

1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/download][continuum-mac]
   with your web browser.

2. Download the Python 3 installer for OS X. 

3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

### Linux

Note that the following installation steps require you to work from the shell. 
If you run into any difficulties, please request help before the workshop begins.

1.  Open [https://www.anaconda.com/download][continuum-linux] with your web browser.

2.  Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.

3.  Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

    a.  Open a terminal window.

    b.  Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the installer

    c.  Type

    ~~~
    $ bash Anaconda3-
    ~~~
    {: .bash}

    and press tab.  The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.

    d.  Press enter.

    e.  Follow the text-only prompts.  When the license agreement appears (a colon
        will be present at the bottom of the screen) hold the down arrow until the 
        bottom of the text. Type `yes` and press enter to approve the license. Press 
        enter again to approve the default location for the files. Type `yes` and 
        press enter to prepend Anaconda to your `PATH` (this makes the Anaconda 
        distribution the default Python).

## Getting the Data

The data we will be using is taken from the [gapminder][gapminder] dataset.
To obtain it, download and unzip the file 
[python-novice-gapminder-data.zip](https://github.com/brownsarahm/python-novice-gapminder-files/archive/master.zip).
In order to follow the presented material, you should launch a Jupyter 
notebook in the root directory (see [Starting Python](#Starting-Python)).

## Starting Python

We will teach Python using the [Jupyter notebook][jupyter], a 
programming environment that runs in a web browser. Jupyter requires a reasonably 
up-to-date browser, preferably a current version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox 
(note that Internet Explorer version 9 and below are *not* supported). If you 
installed Python using Anaconda, Jupyter should already be on your system. If 
you did not use Anaconda, use the Python package manager pip
(see the [Jupyter website][jupyter-install] for details.)

To start the notebook, open a terminal or git bash and type the command:

~~~
$ jupyter notebook
~~~
{: .bash}


If you are using Ubuntu for Windows type the command

~~~
$ jupyter notebook --no-browser
~~~
{: .bash}

To start the Python interpreter without the notebook, open a terminal 
or Git Bash and type the command:

~~~
$ python
~~~
{: .bash}
